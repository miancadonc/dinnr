# Dinnr

This simple web app functions as a collection of links to recipes. The user can save any recipe link to specific recipe books for easy categorization.


## Getting Started

Fork and clone from github.com/miancadonc/dinnr. In the terminal, run `rake db:migrate` to create the database tables in your development database.

### Prerequisites

There are several gems listed in the gemfile, including sinatra, active record, shotgun, rake, bcrypt, and sqlite3 for example. Running `bundle install` in the terminal should install everything necessary to run the app.

### Installing

As stated above, fork and clone the repository from github.com/miancadonc/dinnr, then run the migrations. The app should now be functional. Run `shotgun` in terminal to use locally.
